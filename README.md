# PrimeFlix

**PrimeFlix** is a modern web application that allows users to explore movies using **The Movie Database (TMDB) API**.  
Users can browse the latest films, watch trailers through YouTube links, and save their favorite titles for later viewing.

## Features

- **Movie Data from TMDB API** — dynamically fetched using **Axios**  
- **Favorites System** — add or remove movies from a personal favorites list stored in `localStorage`  
- **YouTube Trailer Integration** — open trailers directly from the movie page  
- **Custom Alerts** — implemented with **ToastContainer** for clean and responsive notifications  
- **React Hooks** — uses `useEffect` and `useState` for efficient state management and rendering  
- **Responsive UI** — simple, clean, and inspired by modern streaming platforms  

## Technologies Used

- React.js  
- Axios  
- ToastContainer (react-toastify)  
- TMDB API  
- CSS3  
- React Router DOM  

## How It Works

1. Browse the available movies fetched from TMDB.  
2. Click on a movie to view its details and access its trailer.  
3. Save movies to your favorites list for future access.  
4. Manage your saved movies in the “Favorites” section.
